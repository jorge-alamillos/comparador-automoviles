 #### COMPARADOR-MOVILES-PROJECT ####


1. OBJECTIVE

I am the typical friend that everyone has who is asked by electronic freaks. This time a friend asks me about the mobile with the best value for money.
Because this question is often repeated by my friends, I decide to create a query that returns, based on the person's budget, the best value for money mobile sold in Amazon.
